### Faculty of Aerospace Engineering

🚀 **Welcome to the Course!**

In this comprehensive lecture, **Dr. Ali Khorshidi Benam** takes freshman aerospace engineering students on a journey from theoretical physics to practical engineering simulation. We answer a fundamental question: **How does a rocket flight computer work?**

Instead of just solving dry math problems, we bridge the gap between high school physics (Newton’s Laws) and real-world orbital mechanics by building a project based on real data.

## 🛰️ Project Overview: Falcon 9 Flight Simulator

In this session, we build a full **3D flight simulator for the SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket using MATLAB**.

This project is designed for first-year engineering students to demonstrate the tremendous power of programming in solving complex aerospace problems.

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

We implement a **numerical integration algorithm (Euler’s Method)** to simulate the ascent profile of a multi-stage rocket. Key topics covered include:

### 1. Atmospheric Modeling
Coding the exponential decay of air density (ρ) and calculating its significant effect on aerodynamic **Drag** throughout the flight.

### 2. Propulsion Physics
Simulating the variable **Thrust** and Specific Impulse ($I_{sp}$) of the Merlin 1D engines as they transition from Sea Level to the vacuum of space.

### 3. Flight Dynamics
Calculating critical flight parameters over time, including:
* Dynamic Pressure (**Max-Q**)
* Acceleration (G-force)
* Mass depletion due to fuel consumption.

### 4. Guidance & Control
Implementing the logic for the **"Gravity Turn"** maneuver, essential for efficient orbital insertion.

### 5. 3D Visualization
Creating stunning 3D trajectory plots and analyzing flight telemetry data directly within MATLAB.
